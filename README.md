# CaptionHub
A place to request, share or improve on captions for YouTube videos. The open source alternative to the now deprecated community captions.

## Why?
On September 28th, 2020, YouTube officially discontinued community contributions after hundreds of thousands of people signed against it. We believe captions should always be a readily available option to viewers, and the removal of contributions is now limitting that option to creators who can afford to buy them. CaptionHub is meant to be a successor to community captions.
